# ae2Colony
A CC:Tweaked lua script that sends AE2 items to Minecolonies

At some point I'll probably abandon this script, so if you want to use it and make upgrades to it, go for it! Please send me a link so I can maybe use it in the future.

# Setup
1. This script was written while playing ATM10 v4.2, it requires several mods from that modpack. CC:Tweaked, Advanced Peripherals, Minecolonies, AE2.
2. The Advanced Peripherals(AP) mod goes through frequent updates, there is a significant chance this script won't work if the AP version isn't 0.7.51b
3. You need to understand how to setup AE2 autocrafting systems, and have a general idea how Minecolonies works.
4. I'm a hobby programmer, it's difficult for me to test for every scenario, but please let me know of any issues and I'll try to help!
