I don't really know how changelogs or versioning is suppose to work, but my attempt.

v0.4.1
  - modify craftingHandler to not use fingerprints, isCraftable() can't use fingerprints as an item filter in  AP 0.7.51b
  
v0.4 Changelog starts here, everything before 0.4 is forgotten to time.
  - Script fairly stable, decent monitor display, pages
  - AP 0.7.51b is the recommended version at the moment
